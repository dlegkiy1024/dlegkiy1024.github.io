			<h3>What is github</h3>
			<p>Github is a way for people to share their ideas and ways for teams of people to work together to make changes to a project.</p>
    			
			<h3>Who started github</h3>
			<p>Github was founded in 2008 by 4 people Chris Wanstrath, PJ Hyett, Tom Preston-Werner and Scott Chacon. They used ruby on rails.</p>
			<p>Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub</p>
			
			<h3>What is hub</h3>
			<p>Not sure to be honest. Im guessing its where you can see what others have posted and you can put your own input on a project or help out.</p>
			
			<h3>Repositories</h3>
			<p>The role of these is pretty much just a project. You can make different changes to it or just pull from the repository to have your own version of it and amke changes if you wish.</p>
			
			<h3>Thoughs on Github</h3>
			<p>Its not a bad site, i feel as if its more of a group thing and if you want to share your findings or need help with something.</p>
